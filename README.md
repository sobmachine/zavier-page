**[A bright classroom scene. Students are chatting and tossing paper balls.]**

**H (narrating dramatically):** In a world where humans have existed for thousands of years, mistakes have always been our closest friends—ranging from little slip-ups **(*Jiyan throws a paper ball at Harshit*)** to world-changing blunders. **(*A sneaks off with Harshit’s notebook*)**

**H:** Huh—wait, what—?

**H (continuing):** Anyway! What if I told you that mistakes love to pile up—gum wrappers, paper balls… or even bad marks! *(*camera cuts to Kanav, looking offended*)*

**K:** Excuse me?! Are you talking about *me*?!

**H:** Whaaat? Nooo! **(*giggles*)**

**Narrator:** That’s Kanav—the designer and deep thinker behind our project.

**H:** And I’m Harshit! The proud leader who started this docu—

**A (interrupting loudly):** Oh, stop your speech already!

**J:** He’s right! **(*camera pans to Jiyan, who’s smirking*)**

**Narrator:** That’s Avyukt. And this—**(*camera turns to Jiyan*)**—is Jiyan, the king of mistakes himself.

**J:** Hey! **(*throws another paper ball*)** …Wait, what the—why did the trashbin just *catch* that?!

**A, H, K (in unison):** What?!

**H:** Hold on—that’s our idea!

**A:** **(*laughing*)** He’s just lucky, dumdum!

**H:** He’s *not*!

**Narrator:** For the record, our final product isn’t finished yet. This was just a glimpse!

**H:** Should we tell them about it?

**J & K:** Tell who?

**H:** *Them.* **(*points at camera*)**

**J:** Ooooh, *them*!

**[Harshit walks to the smart board and starts scribbling confidently.]**

**H:** And that’s basically it!

**[Camera pans out. The whole class is asleep. Harshit sighs dramatically.]**

**H:** Awww…

**Narrator:** And that’s all, folks.
